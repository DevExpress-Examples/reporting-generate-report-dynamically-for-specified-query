In this example the [XRTable](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRTable) control in a report is created at runtime based on the query results. The query is created at runtime for the specified table. The user specifies the table name in the URL query string. 

In the XtraReport code-behind, the [SqlDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Sql.SqlDataSource) instance is created and populated with data retrieved from the SQL query. The XRTable control is created in code, with table cells bound to the data table columns.

The project uses the SQLite database with Northwind data.
